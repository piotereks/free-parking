# Free Parking — Expo App (offline)

This is a minimal Expo-managed React Native app scaffold placed in `expo-app` at the repository root.

Quick start (first time):

```bash
cd expo-app
npm install
# then run the Metro server in offline mode
npm run start
```

Notes:
- The `start` script uses `expo start --offline` for an offline developer experience.
- To run on device/emulator you can use `npm run android` or `npm run ios` (requires native toolchains).
