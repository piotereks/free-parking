This folder is intended to contain the original web/project files moved from the repository root.

It was created by an automated helper. Contents typically include: `src/`, `test/`, `package.json`, `tailwind.config.js`, `vite.config.js`, and other config/docs files.

If you ran `move_parent_to_orig.ps1`, inspect the moved files and run `git status` to verify changes. If something was moved by mistake, move it back from this folder.
