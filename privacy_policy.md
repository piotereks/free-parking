# Privacy Policy for Free Parking App

**Effective Date:** January 18, 2026

This Privacy Policy describes how the Free Parking App ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 Information You Provide
- We do not require you to create an account or provide personal information to use the App.

### 1.2 Information Collected Automatically
- **No Personal Data Collection by Us:** We do not directly collect, store, or transmit any personal information, user profiles, or usage tracking data.
- **Local Data Only:** The App caches parking availability data in your device's local storage (localStorage on web, AsyncStorage on mobile) to improve performance. This data includes parking spot counts and timestamps from public sources and is never transmitted to our servers.
- **No Location Tracking:** The App does not request or collect your device location. Parking data shown is from public APIs and not personalized to your location.
- **No Separate Analytics Services:** We do not use Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics, or similar app analytics services to track your behavior. However, AdMob (see below) does collect data for ad campaign performance and reporting.

### 1.3 Third-Party Services
- **AdMob (Non-Personalized Ads with Campaign Analytics):** The mobile app displays advertisements through Google AdMob configured to show **non-personalized ads only** (`requestNonPersonalizedAdsOnly: true`). While ads are not personalized to you, AdMob does collect data for advertising purposes:
  - **What AdMob Collects:**
    - Device information (device type, OS version, screen size, language)
    - IP address (for general location, ad delivery, and fraud prevention)
    - Ad interactions (impressions, clicks, conversions)
    - App usage data related to ad performance
  - **How AdMob Uses This Data:**
    - Display non-personalized advertisements (not based on your interests or browsing history)
    - Campaign performance tracking and analytics
    - Ad fraud prevention and security
    - Aggregate reporting for advertisers
  - **Important:** Even though ads are non-personalized, Google collects analytics data to measure ad campaign effectiveness and improve ad services.
  - For more information, see [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites).
- **Public Parking Data Sources:** The App fetches real-time parking availability from public APIs (zaparkuj.pl). This data is publicly available and contains no personal information. We do not control these third-party services.

## 2. How We Use Information

The App's core functionality operates without collecting personal information:
- **Display Parking Data:** Fetch and display real-time parking availability from public sources.
- **Local Caching:** Store parking data locally on your device for faster loading and offline access.
- **Ad Display:** Show non-personalized advertisements through Google AdMob (mobile app only).

**What We Do NOT Do:**
- We do NOT collect, analyze, or store user behavior, app analytics, or usage statistics ourselves.
- We do NOT track your location, movements, or app usage patterns.
- We do NOT sell, rent, or share any personal information with third parties.
- We do NOT create user profiles or identify individual users.

**Note:** While we don't collect analytics, Google AdMob does collect data for ad campaign performance, reporting, and fraud prevention as described above.

## 3. Sharing of Information

- **Google AdMob:** As described above, the mobile app uses AdMob for non-personalized advertisements. Google may collect basic device information as described in their privacy policy.
- **No Analytics Providers:** We do not use analytics services or share data with analytics providers.
- **Legal Requirements:** We may disclose information if required by law, but since we don't collect personal data, there is minimal information to disclose.
- **No Data Sharing:** We do not share, sell, or transmit any user data to third parties. All parking data displayed comes from public sources and is not user-specific.

## 4. Data Security

We implement reasonable security measures to protect your information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.

## 5. Children's Privacy

The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected such information, we will delete it promptly.

## 6. International Data Transfers

Your information may be transferred to and processed in countries other than your own. We ensure that such transfers comply with applicable data protection laws.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy within the App or on our website. Your continued use of the App after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
